Welcome to the **Onboard Project**, your ultimate companion for navigating public transport in Milan, Italy! üáÆüáπ This open-source initiative aims to provide a comprehensive, real-time, and user-friendly experience for commuters and visitors alike.

## üåü What is Onboard?

Onboard is a multi-platform application designed to make your journey through Milan seamless. It features:

*   **Real-time Information:** Get live updates on public transport vehicle arrivals and waiting times.
*   **Interactive Map:** Explore all public transport stops and lines on a custom-designed, detailed map of Milan.
*   **Comprehensive Data:** Access information for both surface transport (buses, trams) and metro lines.
*   **Cross-platform Availability:** Use Onboard on Windows, Android, and Web.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The Onboard ecosystem is built on a robust architecture, combining various technologies to deliver accurate and timely information:

1.  **Data Sourcing:** Information is meticulously scraped from `giromilano.atm.it` and augmented with open data sources.
2.  **Vercel Python Backend:** A powerful Python server processes and serves this data, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
3.  **Custom Raster Maps:** Unique, performant raster tiles, hosted on GitHub, provide a beautiful and informative map experience.
4.  **Flutter Client:** The front-end application, built with Flutter, consumes the data and renders the user interface across multiple platforms.

## üöÄ Our Vision

Our goal is to create the most reliable and user-friendly public transport app for Milan, leveraging open-source principles and community contributions. We believe that better transport information leads to better urban experiences.
